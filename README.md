My approach with designing software was at the beginner stage. I’ve used C++ and Java in the past, but never to create 3D or even 2D objects. I haven’t used C++ or Java in a long time so it took some time to get used to it again, but once I was able to catch on to the pattern of the code to see what connections need to be made in order to have the code running, it was a lot easier to follow. One of the major things this course has taught me is to be patient and attentive to detail, as well as to keep your code clean and organized so you can know exactly where to look back to when there’s an error. I think this tactic could be applied to any field in the work force, not just in coding because it will allow you to be precise with your work and attentive to everything, I think when using the pyramid, it definitely helped me to apply that to the different shapes, it was a bit difficult separating a cube from the plan since they were both made from triangles, but once I figured out how to split the textures and assign one texture to certain areas, it made it a lot easier. 
I think computer science will help me reach my goals not only by having a new skill, but also to be patient and the drive to push yourself when you get stuck in a certain situation. I continuously got stuck with an error or something just not working or coming out right when I trying to get my 3D scene or apply the textures, but if I didn’t continue trying no matter how many times I would mess it up, I eventually got the result I was looking for.
